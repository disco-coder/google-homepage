# Google Homepage Project
This is the *HTML/CSS* mini-project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

## Summary
From start to the end, this project has taken me around 5 hours. The structure of the page was done from scratch without relying on the developer tool's, while colors, shadows, font-sizes, etc were lifted from Google's own page using developer tools.

This was the first time I was really using git (aside from TOP's git basics section) and I didn't really mind it. The workflow came naturally to me and the functionality git offers is neat.

I didn't have any problems building the HTML page structure itself, that was kinda easy. The hard part for me was positioning everything. On numerous occasions I would position something and the damn thing wouldn't even move. I think that I was overrelying on using positioning and I need to work on that in the future. Overall, this was a fun little project and I am pleased with the outcome.

PS: The website is broken on mobile, it works on desktop only.
